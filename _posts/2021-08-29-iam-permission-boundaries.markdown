Based on my security audits of few 100 AWS accounts across multiple organizations (large, medium & small) over the last few years, one of the most under-utilized AWS security features is permissions boundaries (or lack thereof) for IAM entities. Appropriate use of permission boundaries on IAM entities can prevent & reduce privilege escalation threats. Well planned IAM permission boundaries will help an organization grow faster & secure with reduced security administration, approval & audit bottlenecks.
